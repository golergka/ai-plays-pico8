# AI GameDev Monorepo Guidelines

This is a monorepo with multiple packages. Each package has its own documentation and workflows.

For package-specific work, please refer to the respective package's docs/CLAUDE.md file:

- For `@ai-gamedev/playtest`: See `packages/playtest/docs/CLAUDE.md`

When working on a specific package, follow the workflows defined in that package's CLAUDE.md file.
