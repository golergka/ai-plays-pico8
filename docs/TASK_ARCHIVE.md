# Task Archive

⚠️ **WARNING: DO NOT LOAD THIS ENTIRE FILE INTO CONTEXT** ⚠️
For looking up specific archived tasks, use GrepTool to search by task ID or keywords

This document serves as an archive of completed tasks from the AI Plays PICO-8 project. Tasks are moved here from TASKS.md once they have been completed and verified, to keep the main task list focused on current and upcoming work.

**Purpose of this archive:**
- Maintain a historical record of completed work
- Preserve task details for future reference
- Reduce the size of the active TASKS.md file
- Allow for easy lookup of archived tasks when referenced in active tasks

**Do not modify this file directly.** New entries should only be appended using bash commands as specified in TASKS.md instructions.

### [T-101] PICO-8 Game Runner [DONE]
**Dependencies**: T-001, T-105
**Description**: Create a module to run PICO-8 games programmatically.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can launch PICO-8 with a specific cartridge
- Can close PICO-8 gracefully
- Error handling for failed launches
- Configurable PICO-8 path and options
- Use environment variables for configuration


### [T-110] Basic PICO-8 Test Cartridge [DONE]
**Dependencies**: T-101
**Description**: Create a simple PICO-8 test cartridge for development and testing purposes.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Simple game loop with recognizable patterns/objects
- Clear visual elements for screen capture testing
- Basic interaction via PICO-8 controls
- Stable and predictable behavior
- Documentation on how to use the cartridge for testing


### [T-124] Evaluate Continuous Input Necessity and Clean Up If Needed [DONE]
**Dependencies**: T-113
**Description**: Evaluate whether the continuous input functionality during cartridge loading is necessary, and clean up related code if it's not needed for our test cartridges.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Clarify the exact requirement for "Demo should continuously send input commands for sufficient time to handle any cartridge loading delays"
- ✅ Determine if sendContinuousInputForLoading function is necessary for our self-written test cartridges
- ✅ Either justify keeping the implementation or remove it (with proper documentation updates)
- ✅ Update T-113 status accordingly once decision is made
- ✅ Ensure no functionality is broken regardless of decision
**Analysis and Findings**:
- While there is a comment in index.ts mentioning that "we'll start sending inputs continuously" during cartridge loading, there is no actual implementation of a `sendContinuousInputForLoading` function
- The current code already waits for 3 seconds after PICO-8 launch before proceeding to either the key test or vision feedback demo
- This delay seems sufficient for the simple test cartridges we're using (key_test.p8 and test_game.p8)
- The current test cartridges have simple or non-existent loading screens, making continuous input during loading unnecessary
- For the key test demo, the code includes a 5-second wait for PICO-8 to fully load (increased from the general 3-second wait), which appears sufficient
- The function referenced in T-113 was commented but never actually implemented, explaining the "send inputs continuously" code comment without an actual implementation
**Implementation Plan**:
1. Remove or update the misleading comment in index.ts about sending continuous inputs
2. Document that a simple fixed delay is sufficient for loading our test cartridges
3. If needed for future complex games, implement a dedicated function for handling loading screens

### [T-122] Implement Test Runner Timeout [DONE] [URGENT]
**Dependencies**: T-116
**Description**: Add a timeout mechanism to the test runner to prevent tests from hanging indefinitely and ensure proper process cleanup.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Implement configurable timeout for all test scenarios 
- ✅ Automatically terminate any hanging test after timeout expires
- ✅ Ensure all processes (including PICO-8) are properly terminated when a test times out
- ✅ Add clear error message when a test times out

- ✅ Implement as an immediate fix before considering a full testing framework adoption
**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Added timeout mechanism to both `runScenario` and `runAllScenarios` methods in TestRunner
- ✅ Implemented using Promise.race to race the test execution against a timeout
- ✅ Enhanced the terminationTest.ts cleanup to handle timeouts and improve process verification
- ✅ Added timedOut counter in test summary to track timeout occurrences
- ✅ Improved error reporting for timeout scenarios
- ✅ Ensured processes exit properly after test completion via explicit exit calls
**Key Fixes**:

### [T-125] Implement Test Status Labeling System [DONE]
**Dependencies**: None
**Description**: Create a standardized system for labeling tests based on their expected status, making it immediately clear when test behavior changes unexpectedly.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Add guidelines to TESTING.md for labeling tests according to implementation status
- ✅ Implement specific status strings in all tests:
  - For tests expected to fail: "(shouldn't work until T-XXX)"
  - For unexpected success: "(seems like T-XXX is implemented now — you should change my labels)"
  - For tests that should pass: "(expected to work — do not commit before fixing)"
- ✅ Review and update all existing test files to use these status labels
- ✅ Ensure all future tests follow this convention
- ✅ Update test output formatting to highlight these status messages
**Implementation**:
- Added `TestStatusLabel` enum to testRunner.ts with three label types:
  - `EXPECTED_FAIL`: For tests that are expected to fail until a task is implemented
  - `UNEXPECTED_PASS`: For tests that were expected to fail but now pass
  - `EXPECTED_PASS`: For tests that should always pass
- Added statusLabel property to TestScenario interface
- Implemented printStatusLabel method to display formatted status messages
- Updated runScenario and runAllScenarios methods to display status labels

### [T-118] Emergency Fix for PICO-8 Process Termination [DONE] [URGENT]
**Dependencies**: T-101
**Description**: Critical immediate fix to ensure PICO-8 processes are reliably terminated when the application exits or tests run.
**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Run test suite with `bun run test:capture`
2. Test fails with native module error
3. PICO-8 process remains running in the background

- /Users/maxyankov/Projects/ai-plays-pico8/src/tests/captureTests.ts


### [T-119] Refactor Process Termination Architecture [DONE]
**Dependencies**: T-118
**Description**: Refactor the process termination code architecture to be more maintainable and modular.
**Acceptance Criteria**:

- ✅ Separate graceful and forced termination logic
- ✅ Introduce proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Create clear process lifecycle state management
- ✅ Add comprehensive logging throughout the termination flow
- ✅ Ensure all tests pass consistently for all termination methods

**Revised Approach**:
- Focus solely on macOS support for now
- Remove Windows and Linux platform-specific code
- Simplify the termination strategy to only two levels:
  1. Standard Node.js termination (SIGTERM/SIGKILL)
  2. macOS-specific forced termination (kill -9, pkill, killall)
- Remove the emergency termination strategy completely
- Update tests to only test standard and forced termination
- Update index.ts to use OS_SPECIFIC instead of EMERGENCY termination strategy

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Refactored the monolithic `close()` method into smaller, specialized methods
- ✅ Created distinct methods for each termination strategy
- ✅ Implemented a clear validation step before termination
- ✅ Added promise-based wait utilities for better code organization
- ✅ Enhanced the process verification method with more robust checks and logging
- ✅ Added better error handling with try-catch blocks in termination methods
- ✅ Removed duplicate termination code from index.ts to use centralized runner methods
- ✅ Added more detailed debug logging throughout the process verification steps
- ✅ Updated all call sites throughout the codebase to use the new signature
- ✅ Removed Windows and Linux platform-specific termination code
- ✅ Removed the emergency termination strategy completely
- ✅ Updated tests to only test standard and forced termination
- ✅ Fixed test runner to correctly handle multiple test scenarios
- ✅ Updated index.ts to use OS_SPECIFIC instead of EMERGENCY termination strategy

**Testing Status**:
- ✅ Automated tests completed and passed (standard and forced termination)
- ✅ Simplified test framework to focus on macOS only
- ✅ The emergency termination level and test have been removed
- ✅ Manual testing successful:
  - Automated termination tests (`bun run test:termination`) work correctly
  - Manual testing with `bun start` + Ctrl+C now works properly - both Node.js and PICO-8 processes exit correctly
  - Fixed by updating index.ts to use OS_SPECIFIC instead of EMERGENCY termination strategy
  - All termination paths now function as expected

**Testing Instructions**:
1. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Create or update .env file with these settings:
   PICO8_PATH=/Applications/pico-8/PICO-8.app/Contents/MacOS/pico8
   PICO8_DEFAULT_CARTRIDGE=input/cartridges/key_test.p8
   APP_DEBUG=true
   ```

2. **Run Automated Termination Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Run all termination tests
   bun run test:termination
   
   # Or run specific test scenarios
   bun run test:termination:standard
   bun run test:termination:force
   ```
   - ALL tests must pass before moving to TESTING state

3. **Test Standard Termination Manually:**
   ```bash
   # Run the application
   bun start
   # Wait 5 seconds for PICO-8 to fully launch
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to terminate
   ```
   - Verify in the terminal logs that "PICO-8 process terminated successfully" appears
   - Confirm no PICO-8 processes remain running with: `ps aux | grep pico`

4. **Test Forced Termination Manually:**
   ```bash
   # Start the application again
   bun start
   # In a separate terminal window, find the process ID
   ps aux | grep node
   # Terminate the parent Node.js process with SIGTERM
   kill -TERM <parent_process_id>
   ```
   - Verify the process terminates cleanly with proper shutdown messages
   - Confirm no PICO-8 processes remain with: `ps aux | grep pico`
