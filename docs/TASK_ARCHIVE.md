This document serves as an archive of completed tasks from the AI Plays PICO-8 project. Tasks are moved here from TASKS.md once they have been completed and verified, to keep the main task list focused on current and upcoming work.

**Purpose of this archive:**
- Maintain a historical record of completed work
- Preserve task details for future reference
- Reduce the size of the active TASKS.md file
- Allow for easy lookup of archived tasks when referenced in active tasks

**Do not modify this file directly.** New entries should only be appended using bash commands as specified in TASKS.md instructions.
