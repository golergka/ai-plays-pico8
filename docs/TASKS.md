# Tasks

## IMPORTANT: INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKING WITH THIS DOCUMENT

These instructions must not be summarized or removed from this document.

**Testing Requirements**: For general testing guidelines and approach, refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md). Each task requiring testing should include specific test procedures directly in its description.

1. **Task Structure**:
   - Each task has a unique ID (format: T-XXX)
   - Tasks can have dependencies (list of task IDs)
   - Tasks must have clear acceptance criteria
   - Tasks can be high-level (epics) or low-level (implementation details)

2. **Task States**:
   - TODO: Not started
   - IN PROGRESS: Currently being worked on
   - BLOCKED: Cannot proceed due to dependencies
   - DONE: Completed
   - CANCELLED: Will not be implemented, with reason

3. **Task Maintenance**:
   - Regularly clean up completed tasks
   - Summarize completed tasks in CHANGELOG.md
   - Break down high-level tasks into low-level tasks as work progresses
   - Do not remove these instructions
   - Reflect on different tasks and make sure that this document doesn't have self-contraditions

4. **Task Format**:
```
### [T-XXX] Short descriptive title [STATE]
**Dependencies**: T-YYY, T-ZZZ (if any)
**Description**: Detailed description of what needs to be done
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2
- ...
**Relevant Files**:
- Path to relevant file 1
- Path to relevant file 2
```

5. **Task References**:
   - Each task should include a list of relevant files for implementation
   - This helps with efficient code navigation and understanding
   - Include both existing files that need to be referenced and new files to be created
   - The references should be full file paths where possible
   - When referencing directories, use trailing slash to indicate a directory

6. **Task scope**:
   - High-level tasks (Epics) are larger features or user stories
   - Low-level tasks are specific implementation details or sub-tasks
   - Leaf-level (in terms of trees) tasks should be something that can be implemented in a single session

7. **Critical Rules for Task Management**:
   - ALWAYS use this file (TASKS.md) as the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for ALL work
   - ALL bugs, issues, features, and work items MUST be tracked here
   - NEVER create separate files like ISSUES.md, BUGS.md, etc.
   - When finding bugs or issues, add them directly here as new tasks
   - Mark critical bugs and urgent fixes with [URGENT] tag
   - If a task is becoming too large or complex, break it down into smaller sub-tasks
   - Each task should be focused on a specific problem or feature
   - Create clear parent-child task relationships using dependencies

### [T-111] Improve Screen Capture Focus and Lifecycle [IN PROGRESS]
**Dependencies**: T-102
**Description**: Fix issues with screen capture to only capture the PICO-8 window and properly handle PICO-8 process exit.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Capture only the PICO-8 window rather than the full screen
- ✅ Automatically stop screen capture when PICO-8 process exits
- ✅ Add configuration options for window detection
- ✅ Update integration in main application
- ✅ Ensure capture works even when PICO-8 window is not in focus or is obscured by other windows
**Implementation Notes**:
- ✅ Implemented window-specific capture using `capture-window` library on macOS
- ✅ Created a tiered fallback approach with multiple capture strategies:
  1. Window-specific capture (macOS only) with direct window ID targeting
  2. Region-based capture using window coordinates when direct capture fails
  3. Full-screen fallback when other methods fail
- ✅ Added improved process lifecycle management with proper cleanup
- ✅ Added window ID caching to maintain capture across focus changes
- ✅ Added advanced error handling with graceful degradation between capture methods
**Testing Instructions**:
1. **Automated Self-Tests** (run these first):
   ```bash
   # Run basic capture and lifecycle tests
   bun run test:capture
   
   # If on macOS, test window-specific capture
   bun run test:capture:window
   ```

   **Expected Behavior:**
   - PICO-8 will launch and close automatically multiple times during testing
   - Tests should show clear ✅ success messages for each test
   - The window-specific test may show a warning if window IDs cannot be detected on your system
   - All tests should complete within ~30 seconds
   - No errors should be shown (especially no unhandled promise rejections)
   - Temporary capture files will be saved to your system temp directory
   - The process should exit cleanly after tests finish

2. **Manual Testing** (specific steps, only needed if self-tests pass):
   
   **Test 1: Window-Specific Capture**
   1. Run: `CAPTURE_SAVE_TO_DISK=true APP_DEBUG=true bun start`
   2. Wait for PICO-8 to fully launch (~5 seconds)
   3. Open another window (browser, text editor, etc.) that partially overlaps the PICO-8 window
   4. Wait 10-15 seconds for multiple captures to be taken
   5. Press Ctrl+C in your terminal to stop the application
   6. Navigate to the captures directory: `cd captures && ls -la`
   7. Open 2-3 of the most recent PNG files to verify they show ONLY the PICO-8 window, not the overlapping windows
   
   **Test 2: Process Lifecycle**
   1. Run: `APP_DEBUG=true bun start`
   2. Wait for PICO-8 to fully launch (~5 seconds)
   3. Close the PICO-8 window by clicking the X button (don't use Ctrl+C in terminal)
   4. Verify that the application detects PICO-8 has closed and automatically shuts down
   5. Check the terminal output for messages like "PICO-8 process exited, stopping screen capture"
   
   **Success Criteria:**
   - In Test 1: The PNG captures show only the PICO-8 window content, with no parts of overlapping windows
   - In Test 2: The application cleanly exits when PICO-8 is closed manually
