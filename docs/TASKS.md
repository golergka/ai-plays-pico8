## IMPORTANT: INSTRUCTIONS FOR WORKING WITH THIS DOCUMENT

These instructions must not be summarized or removed from this document.

1. **Task Structure**:
   - Each task has a unique ID (format: T-XXX)
   - Tasks can have dependencies (list of task IDs)
   - Tasks must have clear acceptance criteria
   - Tasks can be high-level (epics) or low-level (implementation details)

2. **Task States**:
   - TODO: Not started
   - IN PROGRESS: Currently being worked on
   - BLOCKED: Cannot proceed due to dependencies
   - DONE: Completed
   - CANCELLED: Will not be implemented, with reason

3. **Task Maintenance**:
   - Regularly clean up completed tasks
   - Summarize completed tasks in CHANGELOG.md
   - Break down high-level tasks into low-level tasks as work progresses
   - Do not remove these instructions
   - Reflect on different tasks and make sure that this document doesn't have self-contraditions

4. **Task Format**:
```
### [T-XXX] Short descriptive title [STATE]
**Dependencies**: T-YYY, T-ZZZ (if any)
**Description**: Detailed description of what needs to be done
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2
- ...
```

4. **Task scope**:
   - High-level tasks (Epics) are larger features or user stories
   - Low-level tasks are specific implementation details or sub-tasks
   - Leaf-level (in terms of trees) tasks should be something that can be implemented in a single session
